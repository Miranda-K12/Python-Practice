# Oriented Programming: Student Grades Management

## Objective

Create a system to manage student grades using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This exercise will help you understand how to define classes, create objects, and implement methods that handle multiple grades and calculate averages.

## Requirements

### Define a Student Class:

The **Student** class should have the following attributes:

- **name**: A string representing the student's name.
- **grades**: A list of integers representing the student's grades.

#### Add Methods to the Student Class:

- **`__init__` method**: Initialize the **name** and **grades** attributes.
- **add_grade** method: Add a new grade to the grades list.
- **get_average_grade** method: Return the average of the student's grades.
- **`__str__` method**: Return a string representation of the student in the format:
Name: <name>, Grades: <grades>, Average: <average>

### Create a Classroom Class:

The **Classroom** class should manage multiple Student objects.

#### Attributes:

- **students**: A list that holds Student objects.

#### Methods:

- **add_student** method: Add a Student object to the students list.
- **get_top_students** method: Return the top three students based on their average grades.
- **get_failed_students** method: Return a list of students whose average grade is below 51.

## Implement the Solution:

- **Create instances of the Student class** for several students.
- **Add multiple grades** to each student.
- **Add these students** to an instance of the Classroom class.
- **Use the Classroom methods** to retrieve and display the top students and those who failed.
